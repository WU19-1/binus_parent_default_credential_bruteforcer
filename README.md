## How to use this tool*

1. the `for i in range(X,Y)` change X and Y to year range that you want to bruteforce, e.g:
  1. if the student's id is 2201712345 -> then you should input 1999 - 2001 (probability the year of birth of 22 BINUSIAN)
2. the `"_wpnonce" : "X"` change the X by going to Binus Parent and find the `_wpnonce` value from the HTML
3. the `"identifier":"X"` change the X to student's number, e.g: 2201712345
